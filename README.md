I made a tool to do a stuff as easy as possible. and you expect me to test it manually?
> Huh!! I'm too lazy for that.

I have written a script to test [Searchit](https://github.com/xCommunicado/Searchit "Searchit Repository").
This script will run all the commands available for [Searchit](https://github.com/xCommunicado/Searchit "Searchit Repository") tool and you have to **visually** confirm every commands are working properly. *THAT'S IT.*

* Make Sure;
    * You Already Installed [Searchit](https://github.com/xCommunicado/Searchit "Searchit Repository")
    * You Already Installed [xdotool](https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool "xodotool Repository").This Script Needs [xdotool](https://github.com/jordansissel/xdotool "xodotool Repository") to mimic keyboard input.
    * Your Tester Version Is Compatible With Your Searchit Version. Check [Releases](https://github.com/xCommunicado/Searchit_Tester/releases "Releases") For Verify Version Compatibility.
